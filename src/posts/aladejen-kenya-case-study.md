## Challenge

[African Leadership Academy](http://www.africanleadershipacademy.org/) is school in the outskirts of Johannesburg, South Africa that seeks to transform Africa by identifying, developing, and connecting the next generation of African leaders. It is dedicated to 16 to 19-year-olds from Africa and the rest of the world, with alumni from 45 countries.

ALA DeJen Parents Association serves to connect parents to the Academy and to each other, while building traditions and fostering student and alumni engagement during the years that follow graduation and beyond. Established in March 2016, ALA DeJen is committed to the creation of country chapters for parents with the intent of developing a uniquely connected community using social media and other engagement activities to extend the reach of ALA

The Kenyan Chapter ALA DeJen's webmaster needed a simple non-techinical online newsletter that can easily intergrate with his [GSuite Apps](https://gsuite.google.com/) to enable him keep all the members informed. He also wanted a private link for the board members only

## Approach

I needed to deliver this project in single day and on a zero production budject so crafting an all-powerful newsletter was quickly dismissed as an option. Given the absolute request to keep it "non-techinical" , I decided to use the newly improved [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/new) for the project to take full advantage of the GSuite eco-system

The 'secret' page for access by only board-members proved most difficult as the new Google Sites no longer supports single page-protection out-of-the box. In the end I opted to hide the page &share the link among the approriate parties
