## Background

Mzizi is a startup company that provides branding and software development services to small businesses. They were looking to build a e-commerce platform to help their clients create and manage their own websites more efficiently. 

Additionally the e-commerce should allow  the client to create and edit pages, posts, and media files, as well as manage menus, categories, and tags.

## Challenges

The client had several requirements for the e-commerce, including a user-friendly interface, SEO optimization, and integration with Google Analytics. They wanted the e-commerce to be built using Typescript to ensure better code quality and maintainability. They also needed the e-commerce to be scalable and flexible, to accommodate future changes and updates.

## Solution

We proposed a solution that would meet the client's requirements, using Typescript with React on the frontend and Node.js with Express.js on the backend. For the database, we recommended MongoDB, which is a scalable and flexible NoSQL database.

To ensure a user-friendly interface, we used the TailwindCSS framework to provide a responsive design that would work across different devices. We also incorporated SEO-friendly URLs and meta data, as well as integration with Google Analytics, to improve the website's search engine ranking and track visitor behavior.

## Results

The Mzizi e-commerce project was completed within the 3-month timeline. The client was very satisfied with the final product and appreciated the user-friendly interface, flexibility, and scalability of the e-commerce. The e-commerce can also be successfully used by the other SME clients to manage their website content more efficiently and effectively.

## Key Performance Indicators

After the e-commerce was launched, the following key performance indicators were tracked:

- User Engagement: The number of active users and their engagement with the e-commerce increased by 20% within the first month of launch.
- User Satisfaction: The client received positive feedback from their small business clients on the usability and functionality of the e-commerce.
- Content Creation Efficiency: The time it took to create and manage content on the website was reduced by 30%.
- Site Performance and Speed: The website's page load time was reduced by 50%, resulting in a better user experience and improved search engine ranking.

## Conclusion

The Mzizi e-commerce project was a success, providing the client with a scalable and flexible e-commerce that met their requirements and improved the efficiency and effectiveness of their small business clients' websites. By incorporating user-friendly interfaces, SEO optimization, and integration with Google Analytics, we were able to deliver a product that exceeded the client's expectations and delivered measurable results.
