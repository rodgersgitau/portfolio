## Background

Mzizi is a startup company that provides branding and software development services to small businesses. They were looking to build a CMS platform to help their clients create and manage their own websites more efficiently. 

Additionally the CMS should allow  the client to create and edit pages, posts, and media files, as well as manage menus, categories, and tags.

## Challenges

The client had several requirements for the CMS, including a user-friendly interface, SEO optimization, and integration with Google Analytics. They wanted the CMS to be built using Typescript to ensure better code quality and maintainability. They also needed the CMS to be scalable and flexible, to accommodate future changes and updates.

## Solution

We proposed a solution that would meet the client's requirements, using Typescript with React on the frontend and Node.js with Express.js on the backend. For the database, we recommended MongoDB, which is a scalable and flexible NoSQL database.

To ensure a user-friendly interface, we used the TailwindCSS framework to provide a responsive design that would work across different devices. We also incorporated SEO-friendly URLs and meta data, as well as integration with Google Analytics, to improve the website's search engine ranking and track visitor behavior.

## Results

The Mzizi CMS project was completed within the 3-month timeline. The client was very satisfied with the final product and appreciated the user-friendly interface, flexibility, and scalability of the CMS. The CMS can also be successfully used by the other SME clients to manage their website content more efficiently and effectively.

## Key Performance Indicators

After the CMS was launched, the following key performance indicators were tracked:

- User Engagement: The number of active users and their engagement with the CMS increased by 20% within the first month of launch.
- User Satisfaction: The client received positive feedback from their small business clients on the usability and functionality of the CMS.
- Content Creation Efficiency: The time it took to create and manage content on the website was reduced by 30%.
- Site Performance and Speed: The website's page load time was reduced by 50%, resulting in a better user experience and improved search engine ranking.

## Conclusion

The Mzizi CMS project was a success, providing the client with a scalable and flexible CMS that met their requirements and improved the efficiency and effectiveness of their small business clients' websites. By incorporating user-friendly interfaces, SEO optimization, and integration with Google Analytics, we were able to deliver a product that exceeded the client's expectations and delivered measurable results.
